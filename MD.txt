Creating a full project with components, circuit diagram, and code requires a significant amount of information. However, I can provide a high-level overview and a basic example to get you started. You can then adapt and expand upon this foundation as needed.

Components Required:
Transmitter (Metal Sensor) Side:

1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano)
2. NRF24L01 module with antenna
3. Metal detector sensor (e.g., a metal detector coil or similar)
4. Jumper wires
5. Power supply for Arduino and metal detector (if necessary)

Receiver (LCD) Side:

1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano)
2. NRF24L01 module with antenna
3. LCD display module (e.g., 16x2 or 20x4 character LCD with I2C interface)
4. Jumper wires
5. Power supply for Arduino and LCD

Transmitter (Metal Sensor) Code

#include <SPI.h>
#include <RF24.h>

RF24 radio(9, 10);  // CE, CSN pins
const byte address[6] = "00001";

void setup() {
  radio.begin();
  radio.openWritingPipe(address);
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_HIGH);
  radio.stopListening();
}

void loop() {
  // Simulate metal detection by sending a message
  const char* message = "Metal Detected";
  radio.write(message, sizeof(message));
  delay(1000);
}

Receiver (LCD) Code:
 
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include <RF24.h>

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x3F, 16, 2);  // I2C address and LCD dimensions
RF24 radio(9, 10);  // CE, CSN pins
const byte address[6] = "00001";

void setup() {
  lcd.init();
  lcd.backlight();
  
  radio.begin();
  radio.openReadingPipe(1, address);
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_HIGH);
  radio.startListening();
}

void loop() {
  if (radio.available()) {
    char message[32] = "";
    radio.read(&message, sizeof(message));
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
    lcd.print(message);
    delay(2000);  // Display for 2 seconds
    lcd.clear();
  }
}

I understand your request for a more detailed circuit diagram. Below is a textual representation of the detailed connections for both the transmitter (metal sensor) side and the receiver (LCD) side. This representation provides the specific pin connections.

**Transmitter (Metal Sensor) Side:**

1. Arduino (Transmitter):
   - Connect 3.3V to NRF24L01 VCC.
   - Connect GND to NRF24L01 GND.
   - Connect Digital Pin 9 (CE) to NRF24L01 CE.
   - Connect Digital Pin 10 (CSN) to NRF24L01 CSN.
   - Connect Analog Pin (e.g., A0) to the metal detector sensor (analog sensor).

**Receiver (LCD) Side:**

1. Arduino (Receiver):
   - Connect 3.3V to NRF24L01 VCC.
   - Connect GND to NRF24L01 GND.
   - Connect Digital Pin 9 (CE) to NRF24L01 CE.
   - Connect Digital Pin 10 (CSN) to NRF24L01 CSN.
   - Connect SDA (A4) to the SDA pin on the LCD module.
   - Connect SCL (A5) to the SCL pin on the LCD module.

2. LCD Module (with I2C interface):
   - Connect VCC to 5V on the Arduino.
   - Connect GND to GND on the Arduino.
   - Connect SDA to A4 on the Arduino (for I2C communication).
   - Connect SCL to A5 on the Arduino (for I2C communication).

The NRF24L01 modules on both sides (Transmitter and Receiver) should be connected as described. The Arduino pins and the connections for the LCD module are also outlined in detail. This diagram represents the physical connections between the components on both sides.

Please note that for precise representations, using circuit design software or tools is recommended. This textual representation should help clarify the connections needed for your project.
